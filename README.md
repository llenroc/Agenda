Agenda
======
BellaCode Agenda is a small Windows application that helps folks set and follow a meeting agenda.
Unlike other meeting timers, Agenda does require you to start/pause/stop a series of countdown timers.
Instead, you just set a start time and a few agenda items with durations and it does the rest.

If you are meeting organizer, have and follow an agenda. 
Rambling, disorganized meetings are a waste of time and make you appear less competent.
I recommend reading about [Robert's Rules of Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order) 
to make your meetings effective.
